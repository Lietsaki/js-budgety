# js-budgety

- JavaScript app to calculate your monthly income and expenses with percentages included.
- Every time you enter some income or expenses, the budged and all the percentages are calculated again. 
- You can play around with it deleting and adding incomes/expenses.

Note: I worked on this project to learn JavaScript and hence it is not original work.
